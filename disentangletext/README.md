# Disentangling Text

I gave a presentation on two text disentanglement papers at the ML^2 reading group (https://wp.nyu.edu/ml2/) on July 25, 2017. These are the slides. Feedback welcome!

- Toward Controlled Generation of Text: https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00955
- Style Transfer with Non-Parallel Corpora: https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09655
